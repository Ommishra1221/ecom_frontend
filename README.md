# React + Vite

#Intro

Iâ€™m Om Kumar Mishra, a passionate frontend developer who enjoys turning ideas into visually appealing and functional web interfaces. With a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js,

This project is the frontend implementation of a fully functional e-commerce website, designed to provide users with a smooth and responsive shopping experience. Built using modern web technologies, it features a clean UI, product browsing, cart management, and user-friendly interactions.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
